What are snapfigs?

snapfigs are a revolutionary new approach to NFTs - merging the worlds of digital and physical collectibles.

It starts with the purchase of an NFT pack. Inside the pack, you will have cards that represent your ownership of certain snapfigs parts. Some may resemble body parts - heads, bodies, arms, legs, even feet and hands. Others may look more like random items or simply basic shapes. The thing is - all parts have connectors that allow you to _snap_ them together and even pose them however you would like. 

The cards collected grant the owner the ability to purchase physical versions of their parts or list physical copies for sale in our Parts Shop. Meaning that as a card holder, you have a say in the real-life market value of the parts you have collected. 

The Parts Shop will track the quantities of each part sold, so while we dictate the digital availability of certain parts, you, as card holders, decide the physical value with your own sales and purchases.

Once you buy physical parts - you can do whatever you want with them. Trade them with others, sell them online, give them to strangers - whatever floats your boat!

If you end up with duplicates or decide you don't want to hold certain cards - sell the card! Each card is minted as its own NFT so you have the ultimate control over what you do with your collection.

We hope you've learned something here. This is a project we are very excited to be launching and any help raising awareness of this would be greatly appreciated, not to mention rewarded.
